## Details

:snail: _Backend API is currently hosted on a busy Raspberry Pi which may slow down GET requests._ :snail:

The project aim was to build a landing page, in a Netflix-like fashion. Avoiding the usage of any framework was mandatory, hence creating vanilla carousels, modals, topbar, etc.  
Cross-browser compatibility should be supported and the website design is responsive across different desktop resolutions.  
This version will remain desktop only, thus usage on mobile may fail.
